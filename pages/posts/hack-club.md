# How Hack Club changed Coding Clubs forever
**Hack Club** is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit from Vermont, US which focuses on helping teens start coding clubs, as well as other coding-related topics.

Hack Club was started by **Zach Latta**, a high school dropout who wanted to build the programme he wished he had in high school. Hack club does a lot more than just clubs. They operate a 25k member Slack group for teens that code, they provide world-class fiscal sponsorship to clubs and support teens in running events. They also build amazing coding-related things like Sprig, their custom 8-bit gaming platform for teens.

Hack Clubs and Hack Club-sponsored events can be found all over the world. From Cali to India, there's probably a Hack Club near you. As a Hack Club leader myself, I can say with 100% confidence that the wonderful team over at HQ will make the club starting process simple and, most importantly, fun. :tada:
